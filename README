This board is desiged to build a simple 3-axis CNC with this single 'combo' adapter.
The integrated LCNC LSRIO16 provides an additional 16 input and 16 output ports

The X, Y, Z axis and A or two other signals are not isolated, as they connect to stepper drivers.
The remainder of all I/O signals is electrically isolated from the PC.

Combo port example configuration:

Pin Output Signal
1   Enable
2   X step
3   X dir
4   Y step
5   Y dir
6   Z step
7   Z dir
8   Spindle  etc
9   Aux out
14  LSRIO16 output
16  LSRIO16 clock
17  LSRIO16 data latch

Pin Input signal
10  X home
11  Y home
12  Z home
13  Probe
15  LSRIO16 input

All other signals (limits, ext_estop)
can be handled by the 16 in and 16
output signals of the mux. (Polling
delay max 300 msec)

RCLK   <- SRIO-DATA_LATCH (P17)
SRCLK  <- SRIO-CLOCK-OUTPUT (P16)
DT-OUT -> LSRIO-INPUT-STREAM (P15)
DT-IN  <- SRIO-OUTPUT-STREAM (P14)
SRLD = inverted RCLK
