Note: First version, in test.

This board can drive in LinuxCNC a 3-axis CNC over a single printer port set to default(out/epp) mode,
and provides 4 (pin 10-13) + 16 signal inputs and 9 (pin 1-9) + 16 output signals using the integrated
LSRIO16 softwaare multiplexer.

The X, Y, Z axis and A (or two other signals instead of A) are not isolated from the PC,
they connect to stepper drivers that are normally floating.
The remaining 20 input and 16 output signals are electrically isolated from the PC.

Combo port example configuration:

Pin Output Signal
1   Enable
2   X step
3   X dir
4   Y step
5   Y dir
6   Z step
7   Z dir
8   Spindle  etc
9   Aux out
14  LSRIO16 output (fixed onboard)
16  LSRIO16 clock (fixed onboard)
17  LSRIO16 data latch (fixed onboard)

Pin Input signal
10  X home
11  Y home
12  Z home
13  Probe
15  LSRIO16 input (fixed onboard)

All other signals (eg limits, ext_estop, buttons, lights) can be handled by the 16 in and 16
output signals of the LSRIO16 multimplexer with a polling delay of max 300 msec.

LSRIO16 fixed signal connections 
RCLK   <- SRIO-DATA_LATCH (P17)
SRCLK  <- SRIO-CLOCK-OUTPUT (P16)
DT-OUT -> LSRIO-INPUT-STREAM (P15)
DT-IN  <- SRIO-OUTPUT-STREAM (P14)
SRLD = inverted RCLK

Test software to set outputs and read inputs: mx16_test.hal, mx16_test.xml
